# Pixel Art Creator
##### My first JavaScript provect is a single page web app that allows users to create pixel art on a customisable canvas, with the ability to then export their favourite creations as a csv file.  Plan to implement importing of csv files at a later date.

<br>

### Usage:
<ul>
    <li>Select your canvas size (from 1 - 20 x and y axis)</li>
    <li>Use the color picker to select a color</li>
    <li>Single click on squares to color</li>
    <li>Double click on squares to reset to white</li>
</ul>
